# Valentine Popup Page

A single-page Valentine prompt with a playful “Nope” button that runs away and a reveal card when “Yes” is clicked.

## How to Use
Open `index.html` in your browser.

If you want to customize the name and date details, add query parameters to the URL.

## Query Parameters
All parameters are optional. If omitted, defaults are used.

- `name` — Name to appear before the question.
- `date` — Date shown in the reveal card.
- `time` — Time shown in the reveal card.

```

- Hovering or approaching the “Nope” button makes it move.
- Clicking “Yes” reveals the date details card.
